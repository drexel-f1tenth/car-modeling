### Mathematical modeling of the F1TENTH car based on empirical data <br/>

Written and run on MATLAB R2019b <br/>
Only includes straight line tests, which are not enough to finish modeling the system dynamics <br/>
Additional empircal testing and integration of data using circle tests is necessary for a complete state space model of the system. <br/>

The following paper was used as the reference when developing the car-modeling MATLAB script: <br/>
